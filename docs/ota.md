# OTA Updates (Overview)

This repository provides examples and guidance for implementing Over-The-Air (OTA) update processes primarily intended for Arduino and ESP32 firmware. The examples are designed to help community contributors understand and experiment with OTA update flows in a local or development environment. Currently, OTA functionality is planned but not yet implemented in this repository.

Please note that these examples are not intended for production use. For production deployments, it is essential to use secure, signed update artifacts delivered over HTTPS/TLS to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the firmware updates.

The OTA examples in this repository include:

- Uploading firmware binaries to a server  
- Device-side mechanisms to check for available updates  
- Safely applying firmware updates on the device
